                <h4>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)</h4>
                <p>
                  A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology,
                  (abbreviated BSIT or B.Sc IT), is a Bachelor's degree awarded for an undergraduate course or
                  program in the Information technology field. The degree is normally required in order to work
                  in the Information technology industry.

                  A Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree program typically takes three to four years depending on the country.
                   This degree is primarily focused on subjects such as software, databases, and networking.
                   In general, computer science degrees tend to focus on the mathematical and theoretical
                   foundations of computing rather than emphasizing specific technologies.
                   The degree is a Bachelor of Science degree with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information technology
                   and related fields. This degree is awarded for completing a program of study in the field of software development,
                  software testing, software engineering, web design, databases, programming, computer networking and computer systems.

                <p>
                  The Bachelor of Computer Science or Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (abbreviated BCompSc or BCS or BS CS or B.Sc. CS)
                  is a type of bachelor's degree, usually awarded after three or four years of collegiate study in computer science, but possibly
                  awarded in fewer years depending on factors such as an institution's course requirements and academic calendar.
                  In some cases it can be awarded in five years. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.
